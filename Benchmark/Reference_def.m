% NOTE:
% For purposes of examining single actuator RTHS and given the fact that 
% the finite element model resulting from the benchmark structure has a large 
% number of DOF and high frequency dynamics, and given the fact that the model 
% is linear elastic, static condensation is applied to the model. This results 
% in a 3 DOF reference model, with lumped masses on each story depicted in 
% Fig. 2 (see the companion paper). Along  with  static  condensation, 
% other  assumptions  are  made  to  reduce  the model without loss of 
% relevant and necessary information.  Specifically, these are (1) the 
% vertical translations of all the nodes of  the model are neglected as their
% magnitudes are very small compared to their horizontal counterparts.  
% This was confirmed by the vertical displacements obtained from the FEM model,
% which resulted in values negligible compared to those corresponding to the
% horizontal displacements; (2) the beams in each story behave as a rigid
% diaphragm as confirmed by the FE model, and (3) a lumped-mass is
% applied at each floor which includes the self-weight of the structure. 
% Static condensation is applied by apportioning the mass and stiffness
% matrices into dy-namic  (non-zero) and  zero-mass  DOF.  Once  this  step is
% completed, the  static transformation matrix is determined,  and the condensed
% mass, stiffness and input coefficients are obtained (Chopra et al., 1995).
